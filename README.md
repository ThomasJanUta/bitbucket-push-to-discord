Send notifications about pushing commits from your Bitbucket repository into your Discord channel.


## 🎉 Intro

Bitbucket and Discord webhooks cannot understand each other by default. You need to convert Bitbucket's webhook to a format that Discord can understand. A Google Cloud function can translate and forward push commits from Bitbucket to Discord.

I use this Bot as an internal tool to give team mates a way to keep up with code changes via Discord.
